I am honest to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told, I never graduated from college and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.

The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed Colledge after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except when I popped out they decide at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on the waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We've gotten an unexpected baby boy, do you want him?" They said: "Of course." My biological mother found out later my mother had never graduated from college and my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to the college. This is the start in my life.

And 17 years later I did go to the college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After 6 months, I couldn't see the value in it. I have no idea that I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trush that it would all work okay. It was pretty scary at the time. But looking back, it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interesting me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting. It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in my friends' rooms. I returned coke bottles for the 5 cents deposits to buy food with, and I would walked 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.

Let me give you one example: Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every lebel on every drawer was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in the way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer. It all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in colledge, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces and proportional spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it's very, very clear looking backwards 10 years later. Again, you can't connecting the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something -- your gut, destiny, life, karma ... whatever. Because believing the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well worn path. And that will make all the difference.

My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky, I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just release our finest creation the Macintosh a year earlier, and I just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for first year or so things went well. But then our visions of future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. And so at 30 I was out, and very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating. I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I let the previous generation of enterpreneurs down that I had dropped the baton as if was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and try to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley.
