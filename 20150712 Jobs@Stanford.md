Thank you.

I am honest to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told, I never graduated from college and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.

The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed Colledge after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except when I popped out they decide at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on the waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We've gotten an unexpected baby boy, do you want him?" They said: "Of course." My biological mother found out later my mother had never graduated from college and my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to the college. This is the start in my life.

And 17 years later I did go to the college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After 6 months, I couldn't see the value in it. I have no idea that I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trush that it would all work okay. It was pretty scary at the time. But looking back, it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interesting me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting. It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in my friends' rooms. I returned coke bottles for the 5 cents deposits to buy food with, and I would walked 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it.
